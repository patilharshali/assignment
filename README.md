# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Project TODO : If time permitted below can be done

# Json data is fixed and improved to consider diff types of tags
# CSS is applied to look form better, can be improved more considering flexibility
# Test cases not written because of time constraint. But would have written it with JEST lib
# ADA compatibility can be implemented
# More React hooks can be implemented like useEffect or useContext
# Custom hooks can be implemented
# Project structure can be improved
# Validation can be added in json and can be taken care just like conditional
